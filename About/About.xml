Update of YAYOs mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2038409475
Based on the abandoned 1.3 update by Ogliss
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2513695736

[h2]Changes from 1.5[/h2]
The advanced animations have been removed from the mod, if you want these animations you can add [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2877292196]Yayo's Animation[/url] as it already does the same animations.

- Fixed the missing config-text
- Added in the various fixes XT-0xFF and PrincessOfEvil in the [url=https://github.com/Ogliss/Yayos-Combat-3/tree/Dev-1.3]dev-branch[/url] of the original git-repository
- If [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2944488802]Melee Animation[/url] is loaded the advanced animations is only used for ranged weapons
- A big thanks to Ferris that made most of the work for the 1.5 update, without them this would have taken a lot longer!
- Also check out the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2796514196]Yayo's Combat 3 - Addon[/url] by Syrus, it contains expanded ammo handling and some compatibility fixes for other mods.

[h1][b]* Completely changes the combat system[/b][/h1]

[h1][b]* Powerful armor algorithm[/b][/h1]
Penetration becomes very important.
High-tech armor is no longer pierced by Low-tech weapon

[list][img]https://i.imgur.com/9P76nG3.gif[/img][/list]

[h1][b]* Ammunition system and Loadout[/b][/h1]
All ranged weapons are changed to consume ammunition.
When the enemy runs out of ammo, they will melee combat with a gun.

[list][img]https://imgur.com/SWopiu3.gif[/img][/list]

Ammunition is divided according to techlevel and damage type.
For example, flamethrowers require industrial explosive ammunition.

You can set the loadout of ammo and medicine in the drug policy.

[h1][b]* Other features[/b][/h1]
[list][*]Realistic accuracy algorithm

[*]Increased projectile speed for stunning

[*]Fixed armor to protect hands or feet (only when protecting arms or legs)
[/list]

[h1][b]* Options to control all of this[/b][/h1]

[list][img]https://imgur.com/forUaNt.png[/img][/list]

[h1][b]* Detail[/b][/h1]
[list][*]There is no need to use it with other yayo combat versions. The new version always includes the features of the previous version.

[*]The accuracy algorithm is more closely related to the shooting skill level and eliminates the stupid situation of shooting rabbits all day long.

[*]The armor algorithm compares the tech level of the weapon and the armor and applies the penetrating power differently.

[*]If the armor is better, it deflect almost all attacks.

[*]If the penetration of a weapon is high, the durability of the armor is sharply reduced.

[*]When the armor's durability drops above a certain number, the bullet starts to hit.

[*]The percentage of durability at which the bullet starts to hit is determined by comparing penetration and defense.

[*]Reduce enemy armor's durability first with weapons with high tech levels and high penetration. And put the bullets at the weakened ones[/list]

[h1][b]* Compatibility[/b][/h1]
