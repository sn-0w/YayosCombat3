# *** Powerful armor algorithm**

Penetration becomes very important.
High-tech armor is no longer pierced by Low-tech weapon

# *** Ammunition system and Loadout**

All ranged weapons are changed to consume ammunition.
When the enemy runs out of ammo, they will melee combat with a gun.

Ammunition is divided according to techlevel and damage type.
For example, flamethrowers require industrial explosive ammunition.

You can set the loadout of ammo and medicine in the drug policy.

# *** Detail**


- There is no need to use it with other yayo combat versions. The new version always includes the features of the previous version.

- The accuracy algorithm is more closely related to the shooting skill level and eliminates the stupid situation of shooting rabbits all day long.

- The armor algorithm compares the tech level of the weapon and the armor and applies the penetrating power differently.

- If the armor is better, it deflect almost all attacks.

- If the penetration of a weapon is high, the durability of the armor is sharply reduced.

- When the armor's durability drops above a certain number, the bullet starts to hit.

- The percentage of durability at which the bullet starts to hit is determined by comparing penetration and defense.

- Reduce enemy armor's durability first with weapons with high tech levels and high penetration. And put the bullets at the weakened ones
